sample SMART on FHIR application developed using Angular and the SMART on FHIR Javascript Client library. This can be used to analyze the client server interactions and capabilities.\nFeatures\n\nUI rendered based on the Capability of the Server and the scopes the current user has in context.\nCan view the Requests and Responses sent to the FHIR servers for analysis.\nCan perform CRUD operations based on the capability of the server.\nCan work against multiple SMART on FHIR servers using the same application.\nSupports both Standalone Launch and EHR Launch sequences.\n\nAngular is used only to structure the javascript code into various components and services. FHIR server interactions are done using the SMART on FHIR Javascript Client library\nThis project was generated with Angular CLI version 6.0.7.\nSetup\nPre-requisites\n\nNode\nnpm\nAngular CLI (npm install -g @angular/cli)\n\nClone the repository.\nRun npm install\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\nAdding a new SMART on FHIR Server\nThe server configuration for CHBase PPE is already provided in the sample app.\nThis sample application can be used to connect to any SMART on FHIR Server. \nThe configuration details are specified in src/app/data/fhir-servers.ts\nA sample configuration is shown below. Modify it and add it into the array. \nMore information about each property can be found on the comments of the typescript interface src/app/models/fhir-server.ts\n{\n    uniqueName: '[Unique name for the FHIR Server]',\n    name: '[Display name for the FHIR Server]',\n    baseUrl: '[Fhir Server Base URL]',\n    information: {\n        patientStandalone: [\n            'Add lines here which will be helpful for launching the application, eg demo credentials, end points etc'\n        ],\n        ehrLaunch: [\n            'Add lines here which will be helpful for launching the application, eg demo credentials, end points etc'\n        ]\n    },\n    supportsAccessTypes: true\n}Register a new SMART on FHIR client application in CHBase\nFollow the documentation provided here\nAdding a new SMART on FHIR Client Application\nThis sample application can act as multiple client application against the same FHIR server or differnt FHIR servers. \nThe configuration details are specified in src/app/data/client-app.ts \nA sample configuration is shown below.
